# Contributing to `ai-project-readme-structure`

We welcome contributions to the `ai-project-readme-structure` project! By contributing, you help improve the standardization of AI-friendly project documentation for the entire developer community.

## How to Contribute

There are several ways you can contribute:

1.  **Suggest Improvements to the Standard:**
    * Open an issue on the GitHub repository to propose changes or additions to the `ai-manifest.json` schema or the `.ai/README.md` structure.
    * Clearly explain your rationale and the benefits of the proposed change for AI understanding and developer usability.

2.  **Report Issues/Bugs:**
    * If you find any inconsistencies, errors, or ambiguities in the standard or its examples, please open an issue.
    * Provide a clear description of the problem and steps to reproduce (if applicable).

3.  **Submit Pull Requests (Code/Documentation):**
    * **Fork the repository.**
    * **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/add-new-field`, `fix/typo-in-example`).
    * **Make your changes.** Ensure your changes align with the project's goals and maintain consistency.
    * **Write clear commit messages** using Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: add 'securityAudit' field to manifest`).
    * **Test your changes** (if applicable).
    * **Submit a pull request** to the `main` branch.
    * Provide a detailed description of your changes in the pull request.

## Development Guidelines

* **Code Style:** Adhere to the existing code style. For JSON, ensure valid JSON format. For Markdown, ensure clear and consistent formatting.
* **Examples:** If you're adding new fields or sections, consider providing clear `[EXAMPLE:]` placeholders as we've done for other fields.
* **Documentation:** All changes to the standard should be clearly documented in both the `ai-manifest.json` (via field descriptions or comments in the schema if we add one) and the `README.md` files.
